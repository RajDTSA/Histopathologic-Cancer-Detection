# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection

The challenge is to create an algorithm that can identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. The presence of metastatic tissue in sentinel lymph nodes indicates that cancer has begun to spread beyond the original tumor site. This is a crucial step in breast cancer diagnosis, as it can be a significant factor in determining the stage of cancer and the necessary treatment approach.

Detecting this kind of cancer tissue can be highly labor-intensive and subject to human error, so the use of automated tools to assist pathologists can potentially reduce false negatives and provide faster diagnostic support.

Description of the Data: We will be working with histopathologic scan images of lymph node sections. Here's what you have in terms of data files:
